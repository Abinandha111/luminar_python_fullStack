"""PYTHON WHILE LOOP â€“ BEGINNER PRACTICE ASSESSMENT
====================================================

Objective:
Practice while loops from the very beginning. These questions focus on:
- Starting a loop
- Writing the correct condition
- Updating/increasing/decreasing a variable
- Repeating until a condition becomes false
- Using if conditions inside while loops
- Basic counting and accumulation

Instructions:
1. Write a Python program for each question.
2. Use a while loop wherever specified.
3. Do not use for loops.
4. Pay special attention to the loop condition and variable update.
5. Test your program using the sample input.

====================================================
BEGINNER CHECKLIST
====================================================

After completing all 30 questions, the student should be able to:

[ ] Create a while loop
[ ] Write a correct loop condition
[ ] Initialize a loop variable
[ ] Increase a variable inside a loop
[ ] Decrease a variable inside a loop
[ ] Stop a loop using a condition
[ ] Use if inside a while loop
[ ] Use a counter
[ ] Use an accumulator/sum variable
[ ] Process digits using while
[ ] Create input-driven loops
[ ] Understand when a loop should stop


TRAINER NOTE
------------

For students who struggle with "what condition should I write?", teach them
to ask these three questions before writing the while condition:

1. START â€“ Where should my variable start?
2. REPEAT â€“ Until when should I continue?
3. CHANGE â€“ What should happen to the variable after every repetition?

Example:

Task: Print 1 to 5

START:
i = 1

REPEAT:
while i <= 5:

CHANGE:
i = i + 1

This simple START â†’ REPEAT â†’ CHANGE pattern can be applied to most
beginner while-loop programs."""
